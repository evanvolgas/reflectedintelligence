Reflected Intelligence explores how AI systems mirror and reflect human intelligence. We pay close attention to the ways in which large language models and other AI technologies serve as cognitive mirrors that reveal as much about human cognition as they do about artificial intelligence.

### Topics We Explore

- The psychological and philosophical implications of AI as a mirror
- Technical analysis of how reflection manifests in AI systems
- Historical perspectives on human-machine interaction
- Ethical considerations of reflected intelligence
- Future directions for AI development beyond pure reflection

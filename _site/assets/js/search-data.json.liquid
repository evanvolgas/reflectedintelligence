        "excerpt": "Can an AI think about its own thinking? This once philosophical question is becoming a practical engineering goal. Reflective intelligence — the ability for AI systems to self-reflect on their decisions and adapt accordingly — is emerging as the next frontier in artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional AI that executes tasks without examining its reasoning, a self-reflective AI can monitor its own performance, recognize errors or uncertainties, and improve itself in real-time. Researchers posit that even rudimentary forms of machine self-awareness can significantly enhance an AI system’s adaptability, robustness, and efficiency1.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Johnson, B. (2022).

        "excerpt": "Ever caught yourself mid-sentence thinking “wait, that doesn’t sound right”? That’s reflection—and now AI can do it too. In just one year, self-reflective AI systems have transformed from academic curiosities into powerful tools reshaping industries. Instead of bulldozing ahead with potentially wrong answers, these systems take a moment to examine their own thinking, show their work, and fix mistakes before serving up solutions. While our previous article on reflected intelligence explored how AI mirrors human intelligence, this piece examines how AI can actively reflect on its own outputs.\n"

        "excerpt": "In behavioral psychology, the mirror test is designed to discover an animal’s capacity for self-awareness. The essence is always the same: does the animal recognize itself in the mirror or think it’s another being altogether? Now humanity faces its own mirror test thanks to the expanding capabilities of AI, and many otherwise intelligent people are failing it.\n"

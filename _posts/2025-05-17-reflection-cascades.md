# Reflection Cascades: The Next Evolution in AI Self-Improvement

In recent years, we've explored various aspects of reflection in AI systemsâ€”from [basic reflective intelligence in LLMs](/2025/05/03/reflective-intelligence-in-llms/) to [practical implementations](/2025/05/10/memory-and-reflection/) and [security applications](/2025/05/14/relfection-as-security/). This article introduces the concept of "reflection cascades," a powerful technique where AI systems employ multiple layers of increasingly sophisticated reflection to dramatically improve their performance.

*This article is currently under development and will be published soon. Check back for the complete analysis of reflection cascades and their applications.*
